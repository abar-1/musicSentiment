This project aims to match users with new songs they haven't listened to by using their current mood and different genres that they want to listen to. 

There are interactive cards that represent different genres which the user can select and then they get their emotion analyzed in real-time. Subsequently, a song is recommended based on these two inputs and put added to a playlist. After 20 songs are added to the playlist the link to the playlist is shared and the user can easily use the playlist and add it to their account.
